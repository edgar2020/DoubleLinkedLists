Extra practice with Double Linked Lists

Your project must be able to:
Add to the tail
Remove from the tail
Iterate backwards.

In the driver, make sure you call these methods to demonstrate. For example, show the list in head->tail order and in tail->order. Show the list before adding, after adding, before removing, after removing.

Push your code to GitHub. In a doc include the URL to your repo and a snapshot (or more) of the output.

I learned that In retrospect I know very little about how deeply rooted stuff like Array List realy are
